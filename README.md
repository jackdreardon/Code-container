For Nutriply (Nutrition-supply, yikes I know) simply start up the program and input your name, and then it will ask you for 
ingredients on hand separated only by a comma (no space). Type "ingredient list" or "recipe list" at this point to 
view all possible inputs and outputs.
The recipes and ingredients are pretty limited so I could work out the fundamentals and achieve some overlap
in ingredients between recipes, hence the many "egg" combinations.

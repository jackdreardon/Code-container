For Nutriply (Nutrition-supply, yikes I know) simply start up the program and input your name, and then it will ask you for 
ingredients on hand separated only by a comma (no space). Type "ingredient list" or "recipe list" at this point to 
view all possible inputs and outputs.
The recipes and ingredients are pretty limited so I could work out the fundamentals and achieve some overlap
in ingredients between recipes, hence the many "egg" combinations. 

Also, try inputting no valid ingredients or only part of one recipe, and the program will display REMAINING ingredients needed for all recipes! (working on narrowing that to just the partially complete recipes)
